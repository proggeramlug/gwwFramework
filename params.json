We give you our framework \"gwwFramework\" which is supposed to help developers creating big websites. The following pages use the framework.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.ctelly.com\r\nhttp://www.skelpo.com\r\nhttp://www.pray4me.eu\r\nand many more\r\n\r\nWe kept the documentation very simple so far and will extend it in the future. Feedback, corrections and fixes are always appreciated! \r\n\r\nKeep in mind: This framework is actually supposed to help so please don't expect a formally and perfectly organized framework. It is probably quite a dirty programmed framework BUT - and that counts for us - it is super flexible, effective and powerful. But see for yourself - we love it. ;)","google":"UA-1635420-35","tagline":"The gwwFramework a useful, flexible php framework for websites and web applications."}
