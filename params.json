{"body":"Hi there,\r\n\r\nthis is our little christmas present for the world. We give you our framework \"gwwFramework\" which is supposed to help developers creating big websites. The following pages use the framework.\r\n\r\n* http://www.ctelly.com\r\n* http://www.skelpo.com\r\n* http://www.pray4me.eu\r\n* and many more\r\n\r\nWe kept the documentation very simple so far and will extend it in the future. Feedback, corrections and fixes are always appreciated! \r\n\r\nKeep in mind: This framework is actually supposed to help so please don't expect a formally and perfectly organized framework. It is probably quite a dirty programmed framework BUT - and that counts for us - it is super flexible, effective and powerful. But see for yourself - we love it. ;)\r\n\r\nBest regards and keep rocking,<br />\r\nSkelpo - hot software.","note":"Don't delete this file!
