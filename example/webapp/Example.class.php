 * Simple example how to use the gwwFramework. This very simple code is not running as it is given to use
 * and is only meant to demonstrate ways of how to use the framework. There basically no limits of how you can
 * extend this application. Please take a look into all the code files - they are short on purpose to make it easy
 * to understand the system.
