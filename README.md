gwwFramework
============
This framework is made for webpages no matter how big or small. The structure is quite simple:
* webapp/ <= Your application.
* framework/ <= The framework.
* htdocs/ <= public dir

All of these three folders can be in completely different other folders. So multiple webapps can share one
framework without any problems.

We kept the documentation very simple because the framework speaks for itself enough. Just take a look
into the source and play with it.

The given example is not made to run (in fact it does not). It is meant to give you an example of how you
"can" use the framework and to show you how to use it in source. We will most like update the example soon
but for now that's all you need to see to get an app running.

If you have any questions, suggestions or requests just email us at info@skelpo.com

Best regards,

Skelpo - hot software.
